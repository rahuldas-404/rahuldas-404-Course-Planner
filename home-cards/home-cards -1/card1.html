        <h1>Academic Advising Support</h1>
          <p>Academic advising is a collaborative relationship between a student and an academic advisor. The intent of this collaboration is to assist the student in developing meaningful educational goals that are consistent with personal interests, values and abilities. Although many individuals on campus, including academic advisors, may assist the student in making decisions and accomplishing goals, the academic advisor is granted formal authority by an academic unit (college, school, department) to approve the student's academic program of study and assist the student in progressing toward the appropriate degree.</p>
          <h1>Academic Learning Support</h1>
          <p>The University has a variety of programs and resources available to help students reach their academic potential. Some of these programs are targeted to help with student retention while others refine studentsâ€™ research, academic, and professional skills.</p>
          <h1>Academic Technology Support</h1>
          <p>Technology is an integral part of the learning experience. From digital course pages, assistive technology, 24/7 IT Support Center, computer labs, technology rental, to delivery of fully online degree programs, the University strives to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment for our students.</p>
